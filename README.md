# NESO-open-market-model

## Overview

This project focuses on modeling the UK transmission system with an integrated market model for future scenarios spanning 2030 to 2050. The model evaluates different transmission line configurations and reinforcement options to achieve optimal cost-constrained solutions.

The primary objective is to provide NESO (National Energy System Operator) with an open-source modeling framework that can validate and test whether comparable results with acceptable accuracy can be achieved using open models, as opposed to proprietary solutions.
